# PP2 RPC-GAME

The website is a simple implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

## Game Description

- The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a classic hand game played between two players. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by the choices made by the players:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock

## User Experience (UX)

- The website has a simple and clean visual design that is intuitive and easy to understand. The color scheme is minimalistic, primarily using shades of gray and white for the background, with contrasting black text and icons. The use of a limited color palette helps to maintain focus on the game itself.

- The options to choose from (Rock, Paper, and Scissors) are clearly displayed and easily distinguishable. Each option is represented by an icon that accurately represents the corresponding object. The icons are visually appealing and help users quickly identify their choices.

- The result of the game is displayed using visually distinct messages. When the user wins, the message is displayed in green, while a red message indicates a loss.

## Design

### Color scheme

I used <a href="https://coolors.co/000000-545454-999999-ffffff" target="_blank">Coolors.co</a> to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> were used to import 'Lato', sans-serif into style.css.
- The text on the website is well-justified, which means that it is aligned evenly on both sides, creating a clean and professional appearance.
